# Pile Bearing Capacity Prediction Repository

This repository is dedicated to utilizing machine learning concepts for predicting pile bearing capacity. The dataset, sourced from [@kiefa1998], focuses on the static axial bearing capacity of driven piles in cohesionless soils. Access the data through the Google Sheets Link. Key parameters for prediction include:
- Soil shear resistance at the shaft, $\phi_{shaft}$.
- Soil shear resistance at the tip, $\phi_{tip}$.
- Effective overburden pressure, $\sigma_{v}$.
- Pile length, $L$ (in meters).
- Cross-sectional area, $A$.
- Total pile capacity, $Q_{u}$.
